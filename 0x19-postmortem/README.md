# Postmortem: Server Outage on E-Commerce Platform

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** May 15, 2024, 09:00 AM - 11:30 AM UTC  
**Impact:** The e-commerce website was down, preventing 100% of users from browsing or making purchases. Users encountered 500 Internal Server Error messages on all pages.  
**Root Cause:** The outage was caused by an expired SSL certificate that led to the rejection of all HTTPS requests.

## Timeline

- **08:55 AM:** Monitoring alerts detected a sudden spike in error rates.
- **09:00 AM:** Engineers received automated alerts from the monitoring system indicating a high number of 500 Internal Server Errors.
- **09:10 AM:** Initial investigation focused on server load and database performance, suspecting a DDoS attack or a database issue.
- **09:30 AM:** Engineers checked the web server logs, noting consistent SSL handshake failures.
- **09:45 AM:** Misleading debug path involved restarting the web servers, which did not resolve the issue.
- **10:00 AM:** Incident escalated to the DevOps and Network Security teams.
- **10:15 AM:** A thorough review of SSL configurations and certificates was conducted.
- **10:30 AM:** Discovery that the SSL certificate had expired at 09:00 AM UTC.
- **10:45 AM:** The team expedited the renewal process for the SSL certificate.
- **11:15 AM:** New SSL certificate obtained and deployed.
- **11:30 AM:** Service fully restored and verified operational.

## Root Cause and Resolution

### Root Cause

The root cause of the outage was an expired SSL certificate. The certificate expired at exactly 09:00 AM UTC, which caused all HTTPS requests to fail. Our automatic renewal process failed due to an unnoticed misconfiguration in the certificate management system, leading to the certificate not being renewed on time.

### Resolution

The issue was resolved by manually renewing the SSL certificate and deploying it across all web servers. The DevOps team quickly obtained a new certificate from our Certificate Authority and updated the server configurations to use the new certificate. Once deployed, normal operations resumed, and users could access the site without encountering errors.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements and Fixes

1. **Review and Improve SSL Certificate Management:** Ensure all SSL certificates are tracked, and automatic renewal processes are correctly configured.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement additional monitoring for SSL certificate expiration with alerts set for at least 30 days before expiration.
3. **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular audits of SSL certificate statuses and renewal processes.

### Task List

- **Implement SSL Certificate Expiration Alerts:** Configure alerts for certificate expiration 30, 15, and 7 days before the actual date.
- **Automate Renewal Process:** Fix the misconfiguration in the automatic renewal process and test it thoroughly.
- **Documentation Update:** Update internal documentation on SSL certificate management processes and ensure all team members are familiar with it.
- **Periodic Reviews:** Schedule periodic reviews (monthly) of all SSL certificates and their renewal statuses.

## Final Thoughts

We understand that the outage significantly impacted our users, and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused. We are committed to implementing the necessary measures to prevent such issues in the future. As a part of our continuous improvement efforts, we are also considering additional redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure higher resilience and availability of our services.

Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
